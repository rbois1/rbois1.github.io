<H1>My College Life</H1>

<p>I currently attend school at <A HREF="https://umaine.edu/">University of Maine </A> in Orono. I am a sophnmore majoring in marketing and I'm not 100% sure what my plan is after graduating. I live in the Avenue which is about two minutes off campus. I decided to attend school here because it was the cheaper alternative and close to home making it easy to commute. </p>
